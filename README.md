Discover The Coqui - Python Game

About the project:
  This fun two-player click-and-score game, "Discover the Coquí," was developed with Python and Pygame. Inspired 
  by my beautiful island, Puerto Rico, and its iconic coquí. A symbol known for its enchanting song. My goal was 
  to create an entertaining game that reflected my culture. The coquí's elusive nature and distinctive sound made 
  it perfect for this search game.
  
Experience developing it:
  Developing Discover the Coquí was both an exciting and educational journey. It gave me the opportunity to apply 
  what I learned from Code in Place and dive into various aspects of game development using Pygame. From designing 
  interactive gameplay elements to debugging logic and implementing audio/visual feedback, each step deepened my 
  understanding of programming concepts and game design principles. The project not only strengthened my Python 
  skills, but also boosted my confidence in building creative, engaging experiences through code.

How to Play:
  The game starts with a title screen — click anywhere to begin.  
  Player 1 has 30 seconds to find and click as many coquís as possible.
  After Player 1's turn ends, Player 2 gets 30 seconds for their turn.
  Each successful click on the coquí earns the player a point.
  After both turns, the game announces the winner or if it’s a tie.
  Click the screen to play again.

Features:
  Simple and intuitive gameplay for two players.  
  Randomized coquí positions for added challenge.  
  Attractive visuals including Puerto Rico’s scenic background, coquí, trees, and flowers.
  Background tropical sound enhances the gaming experience.
  Score and timer displayed in real-time.
  Supports restarting the game without needing to relaunch the program.
